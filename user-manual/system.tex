\section{How to deploy the whole system}
Before deploying the whole system, please check the Section \ref{req}.

\subsection{Build}

To build the whole system type the following command from the root directory of the project (i.e., acts):

./build.sh -s backend-mw-fe -m p

This instruction builds the three macro components together in production mode.
You can view each step of the build process by following the stdout of the CLI.
\begin{enumerate}
\item generates the configuration files for the city (e.g., district configs, routing tables, etc.);
\item check if the district configurations are sound. Actually \texttt{ACTS} checks if each city
is a strong connected component to guarantee the satisfy the preconditions of the AI. Thus, each agent
has the guarantee to find its path;
\item build the images of the system. Note that this step requires in general some time to complete;
\item copies the necessary files in their target directories.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Run}

After the build process has successfully completed you can run the whole system.

To deploy the whole system type the following command from the root directory of the project (i.e., acts):

./run.sh -s backend-mw-fe

Which deploys the whole system using docker-swarm.
If everything went well the whole system has been successfully deployed.
You can now access the user control panel (viewer) through the browser at the following address:
