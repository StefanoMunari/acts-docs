\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This is a brief user guide on the installation, execution and usage of the ACTS
product. This manual provides also a troubleshooting section with common
pitfalls which could be encountered during the use of the product. In general,
if the troubleshooting section is not enough, a secondary source of information
could be the docker documentation.

For the sake of the project, we will not dig into security details and
configurations of the docker environments and tools.
Indeed, even if interesting, it is out of the scope of this project.
