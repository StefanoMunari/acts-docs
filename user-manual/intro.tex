\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This is a brief user guide for ACTS.
It contains information about
its installation, execution and usage.
This manual provides also a troubleshooting section with common
pitfalls which could be encountered when using the product.
In general, if the troubleshooting section is not enough,
another source of information is the \href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/}{docker documentation}.

For the sake of the project, we will not dig into security details and
configurations of the docker environment and tools.
Even if quite interesting, the topic is out of the scope of this project.
