\begin{itemize}

\item how to set up docker swarm?
\\
To set a local swam master for the simulation:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr <YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDR>

More information can be found in the \href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/}{docker swarm documentation}

\item how much time does swarm takes to deploy the whole system??
\\

It depends on the number of cities and on the size of them.
The estimated time with 2 cities, each one
composed by 3 districts, is around 2-3 minutes.
A small sized system like
the one described is composed almost of 30 containers
(it depends on the number or replicas declared in the configuration files).
