Frequently Asked Questions

- how to set up docker swarm

- how much time does swarm takes to deploy the whole system?

it depends on the number of cities and on the size of them.
The estimated time with 2 cities, each one
composed by 3 districts, is around 2-3 minutes. A small sized system like
the one described is composed almost of 30 containers (it depends on the
number or replicas defined in the configuration files).
