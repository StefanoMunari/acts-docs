\section{Requirements}\label{req}

The following dependencies are mandatory to use this product:
\begin{itemize}
   \item git - version 2.13.2 or greater;
   \item docker - version 17.06.0 or greater;
   \item docker-compose - version 1.17.0 or greater;
   \item chrome browser or firefox browser.
\end{itemize}

This project is heavily based on docker. Thus, the aforementioned
set of dependencies is really light compared to all the other
technologies which compose the final product.
Indeed, the latter are all managed by docker itself.

\subsection{Create a swarm}
After having installed the dependency, the next step is to create a local swarm.
To create a swarm (necessary to deploy the system), type the following command:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr <YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>

After the swarm has been created, you need to create a local registry to store
the project images:

docker service create --detach=false --name registry --publish 5000:5000 registry:latest
