\section{Requirements}

The following dependencies are mandatory to use this product:
\begin{itemize}
   \item git - version 2.13.2 or greater;
   \item docker - version 17.06.0 or greater;
   \item docker-compose - version 1.17.0 or greater;
   \item chrome browser or firefox browser.
\end{itemize}

This project is heavily based on docker. Thus, the aforementioned
set of dependencies is really light compared to all the other
technologies which compose the final product.
Indeed, the latter are all managed by docker itself.
