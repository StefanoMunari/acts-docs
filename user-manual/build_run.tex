\section{Build \& Run}
The creation and execution of each part of the system and
the whole system itself is divided in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
   \item build - this step is necessary to download and create all the docker
   images and generate the configuration files both for the simulator but
   also for docker (e.g., define in which mode you want to run the system and
   which components you want to instantiate);
   \item run - this step can use docker-swarm or only docker-compose depending
   on the configuration chosen at the previous step. It deploys the system
   as a composition of stack, each stack is a set of services and represents
   a city of our system.
\end{itemize}
