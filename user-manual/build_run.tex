\section{Build \& Run}
The creation and execution of each part of the system and
the whole system itself is divided in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
   \item build - this step is necessary to download and create all the docker
   images and generate the configuration files both for the simulator and the
   template configurations for docker
   (e.g., define in which mode you want to run the system and
   which components will be instantiated). Basically, this step
   corresponds to the installation of the product.
   \item run - this step can use docker-swarm or only docker-compose depending
   on the configurations chosen at the previous step. If you have chosen
   to configure the whole system then docker swarm deploys the system
   as a composition of stacks: each stack is a set of services which represent
   a city. However, the AMQP broker and the Viewer are wrapper in a separated
   stack which is unique within the system (i.e., does not depend upon the
   number of cities). Note that the size of each city and the number of deployed
   cities affect this process. It will generally last as long as the number of
   cities chosen will be greater.
\end{itemize}

A logical view which exemplifies the deployed system is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:deploy-sys}.
