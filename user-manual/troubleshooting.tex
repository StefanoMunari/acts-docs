\section{Troubleshooting}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{error: docker experimental not enabled}

You may encounter this error when building our system (see Section
\ref{sec:sys-build}).
In fact, we use some of the Docker experimental features to make the build
procedure more efficient: therefore, if this mode is not enabled on your
machine, you will not be able to build our system.

In order to enable it, you can refer to the online troubleshooting guides for
this error, for example this
\href{https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/01/27/docker-1-13-experimental-features/}{post blog}.

\item \textbf{error: network \texttt{<net\_name>} not found}

You may encounter this error when deploying our system (see Section
\ref{sec:sys-run}).

Even if we set up the right order of dependencies between containers and
overlay networks, this error occurs sometimes.
In this case, you are advised to firstly clean your system as described in
Section \ref{sec:faq} at the point \textbf{How can I clean my machine after
running ACTS?} and then to restart the deployment from the build step (see
Section \ref{sec:sys-build}).

\item error: service failed because the network has not already been created

\end{itemize}
