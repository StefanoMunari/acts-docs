\paragraph{TCP socket stream}

Since different languages may handle strings using different formats,
we defined a \textit{Formatter} behavior\footnote{a behavior
is equivalent to an abstract class in OOP} to cope with these
issues.
We implemented a couple of formatters, one for Elixir (it does nothing but
return the message as it is) and one for Ada. In particular, Ada does not
output the actual character sequence when using \textit{'Output}: in this case
the receiving sockets reads additional meta-information along with the string,
which are basically the boundaries of the binary data streamed.
However, this is not enough; since Ada's Stream \textit{'Input} attribute
reads up to about 200B, we had to split long messages into smaller
chunks. Therefore, the
\textit{Consumer} module has also this responsibility, which enables
to deliver every message without causing a failure during the reception.
