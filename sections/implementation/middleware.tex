%%% TODO - MIDDLEWARE SECTION

Since some runtimes may handle strings in a different format with respect to
what Elixir does, we defined a \textit{Formatter} behavior\footnote{a behavior
is equivalent to an abstract class in OOP} to cope with these
issues.
We implemented a couple of formatters, one for Elixir (it does nothing but
return the message as it is) and one for Ada. In particular, Ada does not
output the actual character sequence when using \textit{'Output}: in this case
the receiving sockets reads additional meta-information along with the string,
which are basically the boundaries of the binary data streamed.
However, this is not enough: in fact, we also had to split long messages since
Ada's Stream \textit{'Input} attribute reads up to about 200B; therefore, the
\textit{Consumer} module also has to split long messages into chunks in order
to deliver them without causing a failure during the reception.
