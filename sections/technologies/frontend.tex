\subsection{PEAP}
Regarding the application server and the frontend, we used a stack of
technologies we found online called PEAP. The acronym stands for
\textit{Phoenix-Elixir-Angular-Postgres} which are respectively the
server-side web framework, its language, the client-side web framework and the
database technology.

In this section we will quickly give overview on Phoenix and Angular, without
spending further words on Elixir and avoiding to provide further details on
Postgres. In fact, the database technology was not a key factor in our project,
since we focused on other problems; also, it is quite straightforward to
replace Postgres with another database by using Elixir's Ecto (which is a
database DSL) abstractions.
