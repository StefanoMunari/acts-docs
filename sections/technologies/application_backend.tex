\subsection{Application::Backend}
We chose the Ada 2012 language to implement the application layer of the
backend.

The Ada language standard was originally designed in the early 1980s to promote
sound software engineering. With the advent of Ada 2005, new features
sensitevely improve the support for high-integrity systems in three major
areas: object-oriented programming, tasking, and real-time features.

The latest version (Ada 2012) brings further improvements, among which for-each
loops (\texttt{for .. of}) which enhances both the code readability and the
productivity.

We have reason to believe that the properties of the application layer
that we are looking for, particularly for concurrency, could be supported
by the following features that Ada provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Protected Object: a structured and efficient mechanism to handle
shared resources access
    \item Locking and scheduling policies
    \item Avoidance of race conditions during system initialization
    \item Avoidance of silent task termination
    \item Possibility to define language profiles (using pragma restrictions)
    \item Timing events: to define async/time-based events with associated
handlers
    \item Buffer overflow and dangling reference prevention
\end{itemize}

Other important properties of the language that will help to avoid error-prone
code:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Safety: writing programs with high assurance does not introduce
hazards
    \item Reliability: preventing errors with detection at compile time
(if possible)
    \item Static typing: type checking at compile time
\end{itemize}
% should we \textit{...} these three features like in Technologies::Middleware?
