\subsection{Probability}
We have built a heterogeneous system
(Elixir, Ada, C++, Python, Redis, Postgres, RabbitMQ)
and made it completely portable by packaging each service in a Docker container.
Also, using other docker tools we composed and linked the services together.
Finally, we provided for each one three different deployment environments:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Development}: allows the developer to
  log into the specific service as it were its local environment
  with all the dependency installed and the multi-container configured;
  \item \textit{Test}: automatically runs all the tests specified by
  the developer;
  \item \textit{Production}: deploys the environment which will be used by
  the final user. Note that the final user has only to issue 1 command which
  creates (if not yet created) and runs the multi-container system.
  Then the user can access its control panel through a web interface.
\end{enumerate}
