\subsection{Middleware}
We have chosen Elixir (an Erlang\footnote{Erlang is a general-purpose, 
concurrent, garbage-collected programming language} dialect) to implement 
our middleware. Elixir comes with a series of features like meta programming, 
the Mix build tool and the ExUnit test framework which will help us to make 
the project maintainable.
However, the main reasons to choose Elixir/Erlang are BEAM virtual machine 
and the OTP library.
BEAM is the Erlang runtime which provides an enviroment to build portable, 
distributed, fault-tolerant and soft real-time applications.
Since Erlang does not have a formal specification for its runtime we will
 base our motivations on a comparison between BEAM and the JVM 
(Hotspot implementation)\footnote{T. Pool \textit{Comparison of Erlang Runtime 
System and Java Virtual Machine}, University of Tartu, Estonia, May 2015}.

\paragraph{BEAM and OTP}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Concurrency model}: the Elixir concurrency model relies on 
asynchronous message passing instead of sharing the state between threads 
like Java does, the runtime itself handles concurrency; 
   \item \textit{Functional}: Elixir is a pure functional language 
so each message is passed by copy, thus makes the testing easier and the 
semantics of local and remote failures the same; 
    \item \textit{Lightweight processes}: every thread in the JVM is mapped 
one-to-one to an OS level thread, in BEAM the mapping is n-to-m using 
lightweight threads (not OS threads) and supporting true multi-threading 
through SMP where each scheduler handle a running queue of Elixir 
processes/actors. The Akka framework implements the actor model in Java, but 
since the model is not natively supported by Java the implementation 
has some important drawbacks compared to the BEAM one. As Akka actors run on 
OS threads, an actor that randomly blocks will block the entire thread. This can
 not happen in BEAM where a blocked actor does not block the scheduler which 
immediately starts running the next process in its queue;  
    \item \textit{Isolation}: the JVM uses a shared heap among all existing 
threads. In BEAM each Elixir process/actor has its own heap;
    \item \textit{Heap Management}: BEAM processes isolation makes garbage 
collection easier and more efficient than Java. The garbage collection process 
does not affect other running processes because there isn't any global pause 
in the application like in the JVM;
    \item \textit{Hot code swapping}: BEAM supports hot code swapping, allowing 
to update the code whithout stopping the process which is running it;
    \item \textit{Supervision trees}: OTP provides primitives to structure a 
fault-tolerant application in a hierarchical tree of processes where the parent 
handles the faulty behaviour of the children.
\end{itemize}
