\subsection{Backend::Cache}
Sometimes it is useful and convenient to store small pieces of
information in a fast and lightweight cache, which implements the CRUD basic
operations on common data structures.

We chose to use Redis for this purpose, because it's very simple and handy to
use and it provides all the features listed above.
Also, since we take advantage of caching mechanisms from the middleware layer,
we looked from a technology which was easy to integrate with Elixir, and this
is true for Redis thanks to Redix (an adapter developed by one Elixir
development team member).
