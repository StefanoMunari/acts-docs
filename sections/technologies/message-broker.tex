\subsection{Message Broker}
Since part of this project is being able to use existing technologies instead of
reimplementing the wheel, we decided to employ RabbitMQ as the message broker
for the communication generated by the middleware and directed either to
the middleware of another node or to the application server.

We chose RabbitMQ over other options for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Important pedigree}: RabbitMQ is known to be among the
        most widely deployed open source message brokers. In fact, even if it
        is written in Erlang (which is an uncommon technology when considering
        the whole software industry), RabbitMQ is widespread as it provides many
        tools for the most popular programming languages;
  \item \textit{Easy and light}: RabbitMQ is both easy to deploy and light,
  	causing very little overhead;
  \item \textit{Configurable}: RabbitMQ supports several messaging protocols.
        Nevertheless, we will use the (common) AMQP 0-9-1 protocol.
\end{itemize}
