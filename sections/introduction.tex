\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document purpose}
This document will describe the analysis, the design and the choices for the
% TODO: Advanced City Traffic Simulator
academic project ``ACTS'' (A City Traffic Simulator).

\subsection{Product purpose}\label{productPurpose}
The purpose of the project is to implement a distributed and concurrent city
traffic simulator and provide a user interface through which it is possible to
select and watch the live simulations.

The simulator is intended to make us reason about several problems that
are common to most distributed and concurrent systems. For
example, our system has to boot and terminate gracefully.
Users of the system can start their own simulations, as well as attach to live
views of ongoing simulations.

Furthermore, we build an heterogeneous system.
Like a surgeon uses different knives to cure his patient, we use different
technologies to shape our system.
Indeed, we recognize that different technologies are useful to solve
different problems. For example, we use Python to easily parse JSON files,
Ada to cleanly handle concurrency, Elixir/Erlang to manage
the distributed part and Docker to ship the whole system as a
single portable product.
