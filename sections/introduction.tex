academic project ``SCD'' (Simulator for Commuters in Districts), a city traffic
simulator.

\subsection{Product purpose}\label{productPurpose}
The purpose of this project is to implement a distributed and concurrent city
traffic simulator along with a user panel through which it is possible to
watch live simulations.

The simulator is intended to make us reason about several complications that
are common when developing a both distributed and concurrent system. For
example, our system has to boot and terminate gracefully.
Users of the system can start their own simulations, as well as attach to live
views of ongoing simulations.

Another challenge we decided to face (in line with the professor) is to have
a heterogenous system, which is comprehensive of several technologies.
