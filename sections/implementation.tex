\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

This section will describe how we implemented the protocols and the system
described in Section \ref{sec:sol-design}:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Concurrency -- Application Layer}:
%   description of the application components and their properties. In this
%   section we will describe why our design choices leads to a correct concurrent
%   system
% \item \textbf{Distribution -- Middleware Layer}:
%   description of the middleware components and their properties. In this
%   section we will explain the design choices in relation to the architectural
%   properties that have been chosen for the distributed part of the system
% \item \textbf{Distribution -- Broker}:
%   few implementation details on our message broker
% \item \textbf{Distribution -- Application Server}:
%   description of how we exploited Phoenix features to develop the Application
%   Server
% \end{itemize}
