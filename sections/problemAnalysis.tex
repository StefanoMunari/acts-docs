\section{Problem Analysis}

This section will expose several problems we took in account during the
initial phase of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Domain Analysis}: description of the applicative context we
  considered to model
\item \textbf{Distribution}: a need to distribute the system arises from the
  domain analysis. In this section we will discuss issues that we encountered
  while thinking how to distribute the city traffic simulator
\item \textbf{Concurrency}: it is reasonable to believe that some entities
  will act concurrently in the system, since the city traffic intrinsically
  contains more than one control unit
\item \textbf{Time}: we finally outline which time issues we considered for
  this project
\end{itemize}
