\section{Problem Analysis}

This section will expose several problems we took in account during the
initial phase of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Domain Analysis}: description of the applicative context we
  considered to model
\item \textbf{Distribution}: a need to distribute the system arises from the
  domain analysis. In this section we will discuss issues that we encountered
  while thinking how to distribute the city traffic simulator
\item \textbf{Concurrency}: it is reasonable to believe that some entities
  will act concurrently in the system, since the city traffic intrinsically
  contains more than one control unit
\item \textbf{Time}: we finally outline which time issues we considered for
  this project
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Domain Analysis}
The goal of this project is to represent the traffic of a city. Among all the
different options we could choose, we decided to simulate a lively city of
the United States of America, like San Francisco.

Therefore, we can make some assumptions about this reality:

\begin{itemize}
\item the city is likely to have a lot of commuters;
\item the city traffic can grow in certain days due to special events or
  recurrences;
\item cars are used mostly by a single person;
\item people mostly commute between two city spots, where we assume there
  will be a facility (a house, an office or something else) for each one;
\item the city-planning is Roman-like, i.e. the streets have orthogonal
  intersections (\href{https://www.google.it/maps/place/San+Francisco,+California,+Stati+Uniti/@37.7766566,-122.4330836,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff}{example}).
\end{itemize}
