\section{Solution Design}

This section will describe the solution in terms of the distributed and
concurrent parts of the system and the communication protocols that we have
designed:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Concurrency -- Application Layer}:
  description of application-layer communication protocols. In this section we
  will expose the reason why certain protocols have been chosen and which
  properties they are able to guaranteed for the communication of the system
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Middleware Layer}:
  in a very similar way as the previous point, we will clarify which protocols
  we established for the middleware to behave as wished;
\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}:
  description of how we solved the problem of computing each agent's path
  in a distributed, multi-agent, dynamic environment.
\end{itemize}
