\section{Solution Design}

This section will describe the solution in terms of the distributed and concurrent parts of the system and the communication protocols that we have designed:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Distribution - Middleware Layer}: 
	description of the middleware components and their properties. In this section we will explain the design choices in relation to the architectural properties that have been chosen 
	for the distributed part of the system
\item \textbf{Concurrency - Application Layer}: 
	description of the application components and their properties. In this section we will describe why our design choices leads to a correct concurrent system 
\item \textbf{Communication Protocols}: 
	description of communication protocols. In this section we will expose the reason why certain protocols have been chosen and which properties they are able to guaranteed for 
	the communication of the system
\end{itemize}
