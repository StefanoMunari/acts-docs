\section{Solution Design}

This section will describe the solution in terms of the distributed and
concurrent parts of the system and the communication protocols that we have
designed:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Distribution -- System Architecture}:
  broad view of the system architecture
\item \textbf{Communication Protocols}:
  description of communication protocols. In this section we will expose the
  reason why certain protocols have been chosen and which properties they are
  able to guaranteed for the communication of the system
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Middleware Layer}:
  description of the middleware components and their properties. In this
  section we will explain the design choices in relation to the architectural
  properties that have been chosen for the distributed part of the system
\item \textbf{Concurrency -- Application Layer}:
  description of the application components and their properties. In this
  section we will describe why our design choices leads to a correct concurrent
  system
\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}:
  description of how we solved the problem of computing each agent's path
  in a distributed, multi-agent, dynamic environment.
