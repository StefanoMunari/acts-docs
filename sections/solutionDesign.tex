\section{Solution Design}\label{sec:sol-design}

This section will present the design of several sub-systems of ACTS:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Concurrency -- Application Layer}:
  description of architecture and the communication protocols.
  In this section we
  will expose the reason why certain protocols have been chosen and which
  properties they guarantee;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Middleware Layer}:
  it presents the middleware architecture and clarifies which protocols
  we established for it to behave as wished;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Broker}:
  describes how the message broker works;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Application Server}:
  illustrates how we handle multiple flows of information towards the end
  users;
\item \textbf{Viewer}:
  explains how viewer communicates with application server;
\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}:
  describes how we solved the problem of computing each agent's path
  in a distributed environment.
\end{itemize}
