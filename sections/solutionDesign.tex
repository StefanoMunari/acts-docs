\section{Solution Design}

This section will describe the solution in terms of the distributed and
concurrent parts of the system and the communication protocols that we have
designed:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Concurrency -- Application Layer}:
  description of architecture and the communication protocols.
  In this section we
  will expose the reason why certain protocols have been chosen and which
  properties they guarantee;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Middleware Layer}:
  it clarifies which protocols
  we established for the middleware to behave as wished;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Broker}:
  describes how the message broker works;
\item \textbf{Distribution -- Application Server}:
  illustrates how we handle multiple flows of information towards the end
  users;
\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}:
  describes how we solved the problem of computing each agent's path
  in a distributed environment.
\end{itemize}
