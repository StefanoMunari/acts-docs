\section{System architecture}
As we previously said, our system is a simulator whose computation spreads
across multiple nodes.

We thought it was reasonable to divide our system in four subsystems, in order
to reason more easily about it. An overall view of our architecture is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}:

\begin{figure}[H]

    {images/solution/overall-arch.eps}
  \caption{Overall system architecture}
  \label{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}
\end{figure}

As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}, we have:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a \textbf{Backend}, composed by the \textbf{Application} and the
    \textbf{Middleware} layers;
  \item the \textbf{Application Server}, which is responsible of handling
    information that arrives from the backend and to serve it to the frontend;
  \item a \textbf{Frontend}, which offers streaming services to end users.
\end{itemize}

We believe this architecture can scale in each of its parts: the backend is
loosely coupled to the application server, which receives updates via a
publish-subscribe mechanism; the application server is almost stateless, since
it just has to store the incoming information from the backend to a database
and to keep very little information for each connected user.

We will try to make the backend respect good architectural principles like
transparency at our best: for example, the middleware will have to be unaware
of the specific domain of our application logic, and at the same time we will
assume that the application exposes a generic-enough interface for operations
like boot or termination.

Each one of these architectural macro-components can be distributed as well: we
focused our efforts on distributing the backend over multiple computation nodes
by using a \textit{2D-wrap-around topology}.
We thought this is an interesting approach to distribute our system since it
fits perfectly the way we can divide a simulated city, besides the fact this is
a topology which scales well when it comes to distribute network traffic.

In particular, we think this topology fits our needs because in our city the
most frequent application-level actions which spans over multiple nodes are
represented by a traveller which moves from a district to (obviously) an
adjacent one to continue its travel.
Therefore, if adjacent backend nodes contain adjacent districts we are able to
avoid a significant amount of unnecessary network traffic. In Figure
\ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-topology} we show a sample city, in which each district
$D_i$ is a backend node and the edges starting from each district are the links
between backend nodes:
