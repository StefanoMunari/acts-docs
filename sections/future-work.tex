\section{Future Work}
In this section we will cover some features we deliberately left for future
work, since their implementation would have costed too much time for us to
integrate it.
Nevertheless, we tried to sketch blueprints of possible solutions for these
problems, in order to show they would actually be feasible.

\subsection{Overcoming worker threads greediness}
In our system, an executor loads work items on a single queue, which is
concurrently consumed by worker threads that fetch items from its head.
Clearly, if we increased the available cores and the number of worker threads,
this work queue could become a bottleneck since each worker thread tries to
extract a work item from the queue head as soon as there is one.

One possible way to tackle this problem would be to have more queues, one for
each worker thread. In this way, an executor may be able to choose among
different policies (round robin, fair-weighted queues, ...) to populate the
work item queues.

\subsection{Dynamically sized thread pool}
For the sake of simplicity, we set a fixed size (4) for the thread pool of
worker threads which execute actions of active entities in our system.
Instead of doing this, we may want to elastically shrink or enlarge the thread
pool size with respect to different parameters, e.g., the work load or the
number of cores.

\subsection{More flexible topologies}
We generated the configuration files for the city instances with a custom
Python simulator. We built this tool in order to be able to produce large
instances without having to do it manually, as well as to have a higher degree
of variability from run to run (if we run several instances).

Even if we can tune several parameters in our generator, it is limited to a
certain set of topologies: for example, we assume to have a street composed by
a sidewalk, a bikeway, a roadway and again a bikeway and a sidewalk.
This hinders clearly the flexibility of our simulator, but it eased our work
when we had to verify the correctness of the system.

\subsection{Uber-like services}\label{sec:future-uber}
The application layer presents two types of RPC:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a traveller moving from a district to an adjacent one;
  \item a traveller booking a parking spot.
\end{enumerate}

In the second case, the message is intended to be sent to a possibly
non-adjacent node. Therefore, the middleware has a system of naming and routing
capable of forwarding the message to the more suitable next-hop node.

Uber-like services are on-demand transport services offered by (1) normal
travellers which are driving a car or (2) taxis. In both cases, a traveller
which \textit{requests} a Uber-like service has to reach a mobile entity.
This factor would have made our system more complex in one of two possible
ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item if the Uber-like provider is specified by who is making the request,
    then we would have to track active entities at middleware layer (at the
    moment we don't have the need to, so we don't do it)
  \item if the Uber-like request does not specify an intended provider, then it
    should be propagated until it finds an available provider, if any.
\end{enumerate}

The first scenario would have led us to a more complex system of name
resolution, whereas the latter would have caused us to add to the middleware
interface the possibility to perform a RPC which spreads (possibly) all over
the system until satisfied.

\subsection{Emergency services}
Similarly to the previous point (section \ref{sec:future-uber}), we could add
another service to our application layer, i.e., emergency services like
ambulances.

This feature would be easier than Uber-like services to implement, since for a
traveller in a state of emergency this operation would be analogous to book a
parking spot (obviously with a different semantic after the booking operation).

\subsection{Fault tolerance -- Middleware}
The middleware is fault tolerant in the sense it is resilient against failures
during the boot phase, when sending messages to the application layer, and in
other scenarios.

However, in some cases a failure of the middleware may cause impediment in the
normal flow of the system: for example, if the process which is currently
supervising a snapshot dies, then when it is respawned there are chances it
never ends the snapshot.
This means that in this and other situations the system might suffer of a low
degree of fault tolerance. However, this lack of resiliency could be fixed by
addressing each possible problem with a suitable patch: for example, snapshot
daemons may send snapshot markers again after a while if no response is
arriving from a given neighbor.

\subsection{Hierarchical naming}
We initially started the project by assigning integer identifiers to both
active and reactive entities. As we moved forward in the project, we leveraged
Ada's strong type system by performing a refactoring and defining two different
types for active and reactive identifiers, namely \texttt{Agent.Agent\_Id} and
\texttt{Infra\_Id}.

While for the former we chose to use strings (more precisely, Ada's Unbounded
Strings) to encode the identifier, for the latter we decided to keep using
integer numbers.

This decision was not so wise a posteriori, since we were not able to implement
a hierarchical name system for reactive entities, like \texttt{x.y.w.z}, where
\texttt{x} refers to the street, \texttt{y} to the way, \texttt{w} to the lane
and \texttt{z} to the specific stretch.
