\subsection{Distribution -- System architecture}
As we previously said, our system is a simulator whose computation spreads
across multiple nodes.

We thought it was reasonable to divide our system in four subsystems, in order
to reason more easily about it. An overall view of our architecture is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}
