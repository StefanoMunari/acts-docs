\subsection{Distribution -- System architecture}
As we previously said, our system is a simulator whose computation spreads
across multiple nodes.

We thought it was reasonable to divide our system in four subsystems, in order
to reason more easily about it. An overall view of our architecture is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}:

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5,keepaspectratio]
    {images/solution/overall-arch.eps}
  \caption{Overall system architecture}
  \label{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}
\end{figure}

As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-overall}, we have:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a \textbf{Backend}, composed by the \textbf{Application} and the
    \textbf{Middleware} layers;
  \item the \textbf{Application Server}, which is responsible of handling
    information that arrives from the backend and to serve it to the frontend;
  \item a \textbf{Frontend}, which offers streaming services to end users.
\end{itemize}

Each one of these architectural macro-components can be distributed as well: we
focused our efforts on distributing the backend over multiple computation nodes
by using a \textit{2D-wrap-around topology}.
We thought this is an interesting approach to distribute our system since it
fits perfectly the way we can divide a simulated city, besides the fact this is
a topology which scales well when it comes to distribute network traffic.

In particular, we think this topology fits our needs because in our city the
most frequent application-level actions which spans over multiple nodes are
represented by a traveller which moves from a district to (obviously) an
adjacent one to continue its travel.
Therefore, if adjacent backend nodes contain adjacent districts we are able to
avoid a significant amount of unnecessary network traffic. In Figure
\ref{fig:sd-sys-arch-topology} we show a sample city, in which each district
$D_i$ is a backend node and the edges starting from each district are the links
between backend nodes:
