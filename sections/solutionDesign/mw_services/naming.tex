\subsubsection{Naming service}
The Naming service, provided with an entity id and its type, finds the node on
which a given entity resides.

This is done in a completely decoupled way with respect to the application
layer, which just provides the identifier and the type of the entity in the
headers of the message handed over to the middleware. Then, the middleware
Naming component will just have to look for this entity in a configuration
file.
