\subsubsection{Interlayer service}

This component is responsible of the communication that is performed among
different layers, namely the one which it belongs (the \textbf{middleware}) and
another one who uses the middleware layer, that is the \textbf{application}
layer.

We show in figure \ref{fig:mw-interlayer} the architecture of this service and
then we will show in detail each module that composes this component.
