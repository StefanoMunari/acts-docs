\subsubsection{Interlayer service}

This component is responsible of the communication that is performed between
different layers, namely the one which it belongs (the \textbf{middleware}) and
another one who uses the middleware layer, that is the \textbf{application}
layer.

We show in figure \ref{fig:mw-interlayer} the architecture of this service and
then we will show in detail each module that composes this component.

Since some runtimes may handle strings in a different format with respect to
what Elixir does, we defined a `Formatter` behaviour for cope with these issues.
We implemented a couple of formatters, one for Elixir (it does nothing but
return the message as it is) and one for Ada.
