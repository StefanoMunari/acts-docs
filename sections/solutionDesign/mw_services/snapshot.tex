\subsubsection{Snapshot service}
This component is responsible of taking global and consistent snapshots by
implementing the Chandy-Lamport algorithm with the help of the
\texttt{MessageHolder} module in the Incoming service, which holds the message
during the execution of a snapshot.

This service is comprehensive of three architectural units:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{ChandyLamportSnapshot}, which is a wrapper for an on-going
        snapshot;
  \item \texttt{ChandyLamportExecutor}, which embodies the logic necessary to
        exchange (i.e., process and send) messages relative to the
        Chandy-Lamport procedure and keeps track of the current snapshots being
        taken;
  \item \texttt{ChandyLamport}: supervisor which instantiates, monitors and
        stops \texttt{ChandyLamportSnapshot} children on demand for the
        \texttt{ChandyLamportExecutor}
\end{enumerate}
