\subsubsection{Forwarding service}
The Forwarding service has to deliver messages to other nodes. This component
is very simple, since it just has an interface (\texttt{MQProxy}) and its
implementation, \texttt{RabbitSender}.

Basically, a \texttt{RabbitSender} takes a message as input and guarantees to
send it to the intended recipient, which could be middleware node or a
RabbitMQ pub/sub queue directed to our brokers.
\texttt{RabbitSender}s are able to make this decision by simply looking if the
messages they are handling are events or node-to-node communication. In the
first case (events), messages are propagated towards the frontend of the
application (and therefore to the brokers). In the other case, messages are
just sent to the node the sender finds in the recipient field of the message.
