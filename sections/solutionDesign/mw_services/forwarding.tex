\subsubsection{Forwarding service}
The Forwarding service has to deliver messages to other nodes. This component
is very simple, since it just has an interface (\texttt{MQProxy}) and its
implementation, \texttt{RabbitSender}.

Basically, a \texttt{RabbitSender} takes a message as input and guarantees to
send it to the intended recipient, which is another middleware node.
At the same time, it also sends any message to an exchange on which brokers to
the application server will be listening for updates.
