\subsubsection{Boot service}\label{sec:mw-boot-descr}

The Boot service is responsible of starting the system in a graceful fashion.
It does so by dividing the start phase into two subphases, namely the
\textbf{marker diffusion} and the \textbf{(own) boot} phase. The procedure is
the same shown in Figure \ref{fig:sys-bootstrap-protocol}, with the first phase
going from left to right and the second phase going in the opposite direction.

In this context, by \textit{marker} we will mean \textit{boot marker}.

When receiving a marker, this the Boot service will forward the marker to all
of its adjacent middleware nodes.
Then, when receiving further markers, this service will just reply immediately
with an end marker.

After having received all the replies for the markers, the Boot service will
request to the application layer to gracefully start.
When the application layer will inform the middleware it started, this service
will send an end marker to all of its adjacent middleware nodes.
