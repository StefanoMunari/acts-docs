\subsubsubsection{Snapshot}
This component is responsible of taking global and consistent snapshots by
implementing the Chandy-Lamport algorithm with the help of the
\textit{MessageHolder} module in the Incoming application, which holds the message
during the execution of a snapshot.

This application is comprehensive of three architectural units:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{ChandyLamportSnapshot} : a wrapper for an on-going
        snapshot;
  \item \textit{ChandyLamportExecutor} : embodies the logic necessary to
        exchange (i.e., process and send) messages relative to the
        Chandy-Lamport procedure and keeps track of the current snapshots being
        taken;
  \item \textit{ChandyLamport} : supervisor which instantiates, monitors and
        stops \textit{ChandyLamportSnapshot} children on demand for the
        \textit{ChandyLamportExecutor}.
\end{enumerate}
