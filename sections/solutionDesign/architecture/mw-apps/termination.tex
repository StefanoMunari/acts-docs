\subsubsubsection{Termination}\label{sec:mw-termination-descr}

The Termination application is responsible of shutting down the system in a
graceful fashion.
It does so by dividing the termination phase into two subphases, namely the
\textbf{marker diffusion} and the \textbf{(own) termination} phase. The
procedure is the same shown in Figure \ref{fig:sys-termination-protocol}, with
the first phase going from left to right and the second phase going in the
opposite direction.

In this context, by \textit{marker} we will mean \textit{termination marker}.

When receiving a marker, this the Termination application will forward the marker
to all of its adjacent middleware nodes.
Then, when receiving further markers, this application will just reply immediately
with an end marker.

After having received all the replies for the markers, the Termination application
will request to the application layer to gracefully shut down.
When the application layer will inform the middleware it has terminated, this
application will send an end marker to all of its adjacent middleware nodes.
