\subsubsubsection{Incoming}
The Incoming application is a listener of several RabbitMQ queues
responsible of dispatching the messages received
from middleware \textit{nodes} to appropriate middleware \textit{application}.
However, this component process the message by applying some
filters before dispatching it.
Indeed, a message may be directed to another node or it might have to
be withheld, if a snapshot is occurring.

Therefore, we decided to take advantage of Elixir's
\href{https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/GenStage.html}{GenStage} behavior.
We structured the modules of this component as a pipeline through which the
message is processed:
\begin{center}
$ RabbitReceiver \longrightarrow Router \longrightarrow
MessageHolder \longrightarrow Dispatcher $
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{RabbitReceiver} : a process which receives messages from a single
    adjacent middleware node (neighbor) using RabbitMQ;
  \item \textit{Router} : compares the recipient field of the message with the
    identifier of the current node. If it is different, then it forwards the
    message to the next node along the path to the recipient;
  \item \textit{MessageHolder} : prevents messages to reach the dispatching
    point if a
    snapshot is in progress. When the snapshot completes,
    the messages is
    forwarded again towards the Dispatcher.
  \item \textit{Dispatcher} : dispatches messages to a
  given middleware application.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Thanks to the flexibility of GenStage, we can compose our pipelines by adding
an arbitrary number of elements at each stage. For instance,
there is a RabbitReceiver for each middleware neighbor plus one for loopback
communication: in this case, we just have to spawn as many RabbitReceivers as
needed and then make the Router subscribe to the events generated by them
(that is, the incoming messages).
