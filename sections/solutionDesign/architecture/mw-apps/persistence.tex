\subsubsubsection{Persistence}

This component is an adapter towards persistence and caching applications.

More specifically, persistence is a collection of Redix wrappers. Redix is an
Elixir client for Redis, which handles all the network communication and
provides simple and convenient API to access Redis applications.
Therefore, we just have to specify some of the CRUD operations for a certain
data structure we are interested in: it could be a map (e.g., for pending
requests, so that we are able to correlate an id to a given request) or a
queue (e.g., pending unsent messages directed to the application layer).

However, we stress the fact that even if Persistence application uses Redis, it
could have used anything else without changing its API (the persistence
technology we employed is completely transparent to the other middleware
applications).
