\subsubsubsection{Forwarding}
The Forwarding application delivers messages to other nodes. This component
comprise just an interface (\texttt{MQProxy}) and its
implementation (\texttt{RabbitSender}).

Basically, a \texttt{RabbitSender} takes a message as input and guarantees to
send it to the intended recipient, which could be middleware node or a
RabbitMQ pub/sub queue shared with the other message brokers.
\texttt{RabbitSender}s are able to make this decision by simply looking if the
messages they are handling are events or communications between districts.
In the former case, the messages are propagated towards the frontend of the
application (and therefore to the brokers). In the latter case, the messages are
sent to the district specified as the recipient of the message.
