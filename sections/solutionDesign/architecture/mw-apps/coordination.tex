\subsubsubsection{Coordination}

This component is responsible of the supervising the life-cycle of an
application run on our middleware, so our backend is able to operate
cohesively.

There are just two architectural units which compose this service:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a \texttt{Coordinator} initiates the boot process when requested and the
  termination process when the time limit for the application elapses;
\item \texttt{Monitor}s supervise the status of some services. In
  particular, we instantiated two monitor processes, one for the boot process
  and another one for the termination process. If a process $X$ does not end
  within a pre-configured time limit (we arbitrarily set 15 seconds for this
  parameter) after being started, the monitor issues again a request to
  perform $X$.
\end{enumerate}
