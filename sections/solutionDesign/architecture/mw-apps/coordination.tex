\subsubsubsection{Coordination}

This component is responsible of the supervising the life-cycle of the
application related to the middleware. Thus our backend can be seen as a unit.

There are two architectural units which compose this service:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Coordinator} : initiates the boot process when requested and the
  termination process when the time limit for the application elapses;
\item \textit{Monitors} : supervise the status of some processes. In
  particular, we instantiated two monitor processes, one for the boot process
  and another one for the termination process. If a process $X$ does not end
  within a pre-configured time limit (we arbitrarily set 15 seconds for this
  parameter) after being started, the monitor issues again a request to
  perform $X$.
\end{enumerate}
