\subsubsubsection{Boot}\label{sec:mw-boot-descr}

The Boot application is responsible of starting the distributed
system in a graceful fashion.
It does so by dividing the start process in two steps, namely the
\textbf{marker diffusion} and its \textbf{(own) boot}. The procedure is
the same shown in Figure \ref{fig:sys-bootstrap-protocol}: the first step
is described by reading the figure from left to right
while the second one can be seen reading the same figure
in the opposite direction.
\\

In this context, by \textit{marker} we will mean \textit{boot marker}.
\\

When receiving a marker, the Boot application forwards the marker to all
of its adjacent middleware nodes.
Then, when receiving further markers, this application will just reply
immediately with an end marker.

After having received all the end marker replies,
the Boot application will start the application layer
by sending a boot request to it.
When the application layer replies with an ack, the node has complete its boot
and it replies with an end marker to all of its adjacent middleware nodes.
