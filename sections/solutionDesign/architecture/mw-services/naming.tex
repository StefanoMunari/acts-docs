\subsubsubsection{Naming service}
The Naming service, fed with an reactive
entity id and its type, finds the node on
which a given reactive entity resides.

This is completely decoupled from the application
layer, which just provides the identifier and the type of the entity in the
headers of the message handed over to the middleware. Then, the
Naming component just have to look up for the node on which the reactive
entity resides through a local configuration file.
