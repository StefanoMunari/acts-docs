\paragraph{Types of entities}
Three types of entities have been identified
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Active}: an entity capable to start an action by itself,
  providing it the computational resources it needs;
  \item \textit{Reactive}: an entity with an inner state, that only acts on
reaction to external inputs, and it is not capable to start an action by itself;
  \item \textit{Passive}: an entity with an internal state (if necessary) which
is immutable. As a Reactive entity it only acts on reaction to external inputs,
and it is not capable to start an action by itself.
\end{itemize}

Reactive & road, crossroads, sidewalk, bike lane, crossing, house \\ \hline

Entity types have the following dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Active} entities provides inputs to the \textit{Reactive}
entities (solid line);
  \item \textit{Active} and \textit{Reactive} entities can use \textit{Passive}
entities, the dependency is not strict (dashed line).
\end{itemize}
