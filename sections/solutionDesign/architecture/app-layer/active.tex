\subsubsubsection{Active entities}
This package includes the hierarchies for active entities, along with some
additional scaffolding to make them work
(e.g., \texttt{Builders} or \texttt{Utils} packages).

At the root of this hierarchy there is the \texttt{Agent} interface, which is
used by the scheduler's worker threads to run active entities. Here we can also
find other interfaces and abstract classes, like \texttt{PeopleCarrier},
\texttt{Traveller} and \texttt{Vehicle}.

The hierarchies have been designed to be easily extensible.
In particular, the \texttt{Traveller} hierarchy has a parallel hierarchy of
\textbf{Extractors}: these modules are needed to extract state information from
the travelers when they have to be marshalled.
Separating the hierarchies allows to not affect the interface
of other travelers, the drawback of this approach consist in maintaining
two separated hierarchies.

% We used several architectural design patterns, for instance the
% \textit{Decorator} or the \textit{Strategy} patterns. For example, a private
% motor vehicle (e.g., a car) could land some of its passengers before invoking
% the traveler's superclass implementation, which makes it advance its travel.

More details about Active packages can be found in the source code itself,
which has been thoroughly commented.
