\subsubsection{Solution to Concurrency Problems}

Our solution addresses the problems we pointed out in section
\ref{sec:pa-concurrency}: here we are providing answers to the questions we
made ourselves at the beginning of the development.

\paragraph{How can we recognize that a situation is suitable to present
concurrency?} There are several active entities in our application: pedestrians,
cars, bikes and buses. They act because of their own initiative, so they are
likely to be considered as active tasks.

Moreover, their actions cause side-effects to reactive entities like roads.
Consequently, our application does not only need to be parallel 
but also \textit{concurrent}.

\paragraph{How concurrent accesses will be managed? Will it make sense to
discern side-effect accesses (procedures) from read-only accesses
(\textit{functions})?} Concurrent accesses will be managed by means of
Protected Objects, i.e. resources that can be accessed in concurrent read
\textbf{or} mutual exclusive write mode.

It indeed makes sense to have the mentioned separation. 
It may be useful to modify roads' status when vehicles travel through them. 
Furthermore it might be useful to get information from them 
when someone asks for it (without causing side-effects).

\paragraph{Which entities have to be active?} 
In light of active entities undertake spontaneous actions, in our context they are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Moving entities, which move around the city according to their own will;
  \item Semaphores, which autonomously changes its color by the time elapses.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Which entities have to be reactive?} 
Roads (with all their parts) and crossroads should be reactive entities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A road is used to travel towards a destination and it take actions only when it is trodden. 
  However, the state of a road is composed of the states 
  of the reactive sub-entities it comprises, i.e. stretches and houses;
  \item A Crossroads coordinates the traffic at road intersections 
  exclusively whenever a moving entity requires to cross it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Which entities have to be passive?} 
Passive entities can not alter its internal state. 
Therefore, road signs fit perfectly in this definition, since
they represent some immutable information that is read by road users.

\paragraph{Should we use any formal technique to proof the correctness 
of the system properties relating to concurrence?} 
We will strive to motivate the correctness of our application 
but we deliberately do not choose any specific technique.

\paragraph{Do we have the possibility to incur a non-valid state? 
If so, how do we handle the problem?} 
The application will be designed to avoid non-valid states. 
However, if the system recognizes it is in a non-valid state, 
it recovery the execution from the last valid snapshot.

\paragraph{How can we avoid possible starvation scenarios?} 
The application will be designed to overcome starvation scenarios.

\subsubsection{Solution to Domain Problems}

In section \ref{sec:pa-domain-problems} some problems 
inherently related to the application domain are explained, 
and our solution design is thought to solve them.

\paragraph{Pedestrian Deadlock} 
After detecting this scenario with a bit of application logic, 
the system will solve the situation by moving at the same
time pedestrians to the start of the next road stretch.

\paragraph{Rear-end Collisions} 
If the next road stretch of a moving entity route is already occupied,
the entity will wait for the stretch to become free 
before moving on.

\paragraph{Stretch Parallelism} One sidewalk stretch may contain more than one pedestrian at a time.
Hence, it is sufficient to add a counter which represents
the number of entities currently treading the stretch, 
denying the possibility to enter the stretch if it is ``full''.

\paragraph{Yield rules} The logic to manage yield rules will be encapsulated in
crossroads, which has to ensure the respect of the street code by the vehicles.
