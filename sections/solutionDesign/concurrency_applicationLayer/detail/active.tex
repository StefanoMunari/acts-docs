\subsubsubsection{Active entities}
This package includes the hierarchies for active entities, along with some
additional scaffolding to make them work (e.g., builders or Utils packages).

At the root of this hierarchy there is the \texttt{Agent} interface, which is
used by the scheduler's worker threads to run active entities. Here we can also
find other interfaces and abstract classes, like \texttt{PeopleCarrier},
\texttt{Traveller} and \texttt{Vehicle}.

In particular, the traveller hierarchy has a parallel hierarchy of
\textbf{extractors}: these modules are needed to extract state information from
the travellers when they have to be marshalled.

We used several architectural design patterns, for instance the
\textit{Decorator} or the \textit{Strategy} patterns. For example, a private
motor vehicle (e.g., a car) could land some of its passengers before invoking
the Traveller's superclass implementation, which makes it advance its travel.
