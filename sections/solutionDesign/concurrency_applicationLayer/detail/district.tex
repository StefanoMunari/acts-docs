  \item \textbf{Description} \\
It represents the master entity of the application layer. 
It has the responsibility to boot and shutdown the application layer.
  \item \textbf{Attribute}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{- app: Application} \\
A reference to the interface of the application layer.
    \item \texttt{- roadMap: ArrayList<UrbanEntity>} \\
The urban entities of the district\footnote{Note that the name 
\textit{district} is only a convetion, indeed it is possible to have a 
real district splitted into different logical nodes of the system}
(i.e. crossroads and streets). 
    \item \texttt{- population: ArrayList<MovingEntity>} \\
The moving entities that initially (at bootstrap time) reside on the district.
    \item \texttt{- director: UEDirector} \\ 
The director of the city building process.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Operation}
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item \texttt{- boot() : boolean} \\
Boots the application layer running all the active entities of the 
district\footnote{The traffic light is a particular active entity that 
is started by its crossroads when the latter is created}. 
Returns true if the process completes neatly, false otherwise. 
This method is internally used by init.
    \item \texttt{+ init(config: FilePath) : boolean} \\
Creates and boots all the entities of the district according to the 
configuration file. Returns true if the process completes neatly, false 
otherwise.
    \item \texttt{+ shutdown() : boolean} \\
Terminates the district. Returns true if the process completes neatly,
false otherwise.
    \item \texttt{+ enter(entity: MovingEntity) : boolean} \\
Notifies the district to add a new moving entity to the population.
Returns true if the process completes neatly, false otherwise.
    \item \texttt{+ exit(entity: MovingEntity) : boolean} \\
Notifies the district to pass a moving entity from the roadMap to the 
application layer interface which communicates to the middleware layer.
Returns true if the process completes neatly, false otherwise.
