\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\descr} \\
It implements the bus stop road sign. It queries a pedestrian to know if it wants to wait for the bus.
  \item \textbf{\ops}
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item[+] \texttt{apply(pedestrian: Pedestrian)} \\
Notifies the pedestrian to know if it wants to wait for the bus. If the pedestrian wants
to take the bus then a timeout is registered for the pedestrian.
    \item[+] \texttt{\textit{apply(vehicle: Vehicle)}} \\
Does not do anything because a bus stop haves no effect on a vehicle.
