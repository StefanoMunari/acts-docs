\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\descr} \\
    It represents a stretch entity. It is a protected object.
  \item \textbf{\attrs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{size: Unsigned Int} \\
The size of the stretch/treading queue.
    \item \texttt{treaders: AbstractQueue<Traveller>} \\
The queue of travellers which are treading the stretch. If the concrete type
is PriorityQueue then the stretch allows the overtaking between the travellers.
This is implemented through a priority queue ordered by decreasing speed.
    \item \texttt{incomers: AbstractQueue<Traveller>} \\
The queue of travellers which are waiting to tread the stretch. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\ops}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[\#] \texttt{Stretch(size: Unsigned Int)} \\
Creates a stretch object with a specific size.
    \item[+] \texttt{tread(traveller: Traveller)} \\
Implements the stretch treading. The current speed of the traveller
is calculated first, then the traveller is placed in a treading queue which has a  
timeout. When this timeout expires, the queue is flushed and the traveller can
proceed along their route.
