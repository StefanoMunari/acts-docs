  It is a static class because it is composed of only static methods.
  \item \textbf{\ops}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{DistrictStopper()} \\
    Private and unique constructor because the class provides only static methods 
    so there are no reasons a client creates instances of it.
    \item[+] \texttt{\underline{shutdown() : boolean}} \\
    Terminates the district. Returns true if the process completes neatly,
    false otherwise.
