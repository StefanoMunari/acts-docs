\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description} \\
    It represents an entity that moves through the city, consuming its 
route at each stretch treaded.
  \item \textbf{Attribute}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{- id: Unsigned Int} \\
A unique identifier, useful to keep track of each entity.
    \item \texttt{- state: Enum} \\
The possible states of the entity \{ running, stopped \}.
    \item \texttt{- route: ArrayList<UrbanEntity>} \\
The route of urban entities that the entity has to tread.
    \item \texttt{- maxSpeed: Unsigned Int} \\
The maximum possible speed for the entity.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Operation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{- changeState(state: Enum)} \\
Change the entity state. This method is used internally by public methods to 
change the entity behaviour.
    \item \texttt{- setSpeedLimit(speed: Unsigned Int)} \\
Updates the maximum speed of the entity.
    \item  \texttt{+ MovingEntity(route: ArrayList<UrbanEntity>)} \\
Creates a moving entity setting its route.
    \item  \texttt{+ run()} \\
Activates the entity which sets its state to \textit{running} and 
starts consuming its route.
    \item  \texttt{+ stop()} \\
Stops the entity which sets its state to \textit{stopped}.
   \item  \texttt{+ getMaxSpeed() : Unsigned Int} \\
Returns the maximum speed of the entity.
     \item  \texttt{+ getId() : Unsigned Int} \\
Returns the id of the entity. 
    \item  \texttt{+ notify(house: House) : ArrayList<Pedestrian>} \\
Decide if it want to rest in the house according to its route: in this case
returns a list of pedestrian which wants to stay in the house, otherwise returns
an empty list.
    \item  \texttt{+ update(roadsign: RoadSign) : boolean} \\
Check the road sign concrete type and then behaves according to it (i.e. if the
road sign is a speed limit it updates its maxSpeed using this.setSpeedLimit(roadsign.getLimit())). Returns true if completed correctly/action accepted, false otherwise.
