\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\descr} \\
    It represents an entity that has two possible colors (green, red) and switch
between them after a specified period of time. It is the subject of each 
crossroads/observer.
  \item \textbf{\attrs}
  \begin{itemize}
    %\item \texttt{state: ActiveEntityState} \\
%The executive state of the entity.
    \item \texttt{color: TrafficLightColor} \\
The color undertaken by the entity.
    \item \texttt{crossroads: Collection<Crossroads>} \\
The observers that needs to be notified when the traffic light \textit{color} 
changes.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\ops}
  \begin{itemize}
    %\item \texttt{changeState(state: ActiveEntityState)} \\
%Change the entity state. This method is used internally by public methods to 
%change the entity behaviour.
    \item \texttt{changeColor(color: TrafficLightColor)} \\
Change the entity color. This method is used internally by public methods to 
switch between entity colors.
    \item \texttt{notify(color: TrafficLightColor)} \\
Loops through the observer collection updating each crossroads state with the 
color passed as parameter. 
    \item[+] \texttt{act()} \\
If its color is \textit{green} then it notifies the crossroads 
(passing the \textit{red} color) and then changes its color to red, 
otherwise it changes its color to \textit{green} and then notifies 
the crossroad(passing the \textit{red} color).
After this process it waits for n seconds.
    \item[+] \texttt{attach(crossroads: Crossroads)} \\
Adds the crossroads to the observer collection.
    \item[+] \texttt{detach(crossroads: Crossroads)} \\
Removes the crossroads from the observer collection.
