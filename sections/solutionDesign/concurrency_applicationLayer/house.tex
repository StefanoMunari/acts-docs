\subsubsection{House}
A house (or facility) is populated by individuals (people).
A house exposes the following functional channels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{register(entity, segmentIndex)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{description}: it puts an entity into a house
		\item \textit{use}: bootstrap phase
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Notes:
Freezing sleep could be tricky: how to save the partial timeout we reached? It could be useful to save a timestamp of sleep beginning too.
