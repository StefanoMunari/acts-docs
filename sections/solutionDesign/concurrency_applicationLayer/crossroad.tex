\subsubsection{Crossroad}
A crossroad is a road intersection and it offers the following functional channels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{cross(entity, from, to)}
	\\Moves an entity from a street to another one
\end{itemize}
%Crossroadsâ€™ operations called by entities or roads.
Notes:
A crossroads has to encapsulate internally the logic that allows the entities to proceed neatly, i.e. way rules.
