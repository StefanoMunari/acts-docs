\subsubsection{Crossroad}
A crossroad is an intersection between roads.
X are entities | roads that call crossroadsâ€™ operation(s).
A crossroad exposes the following functional channels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{cross(from, to, who)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{description}: moves an entity from a street to another one
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Notes:
A crossroads has to encapsulate internally the logic that allows the entities to proceed neatly, i.e. way rules.
