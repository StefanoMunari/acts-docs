A Road is made of stretches and it offers the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{register(entityId : String, stretchIndex : int, laneId : String)}
	\\Puts an entity into the road stretch identified by \texttt{stretchIndex}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Use}: boostrap phase
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{enter(entityId : String, type : EntityType)}
	\\Puts an entity into the Road in the rightmost lane available for the entity type
	\begin{itemize}
		\item E.g. a car will not enter the road on a sidewalk
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{advance(entityId : String, direction : Direction, velocity : double)}
	\\Moves an entity forward along the Road	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The entity velocity is calculated by each stretch taking a specific range of possible values according to the entity type;
		\item If the end of the road has been reached the entity is notified providing it the list of the adjacent roads.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{change(entityId : String, direction : Direction, velocity : double)}
	\\Moves an entity to next stretch in the given direction (left or right)	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the end of the road is reached, it does not allow to change lane and it sends a message for notifying the entity
		\item If no more lanes for the entity type are available in the given direction, it sends a message for notifying the entity
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{hitchhike(pedestrianId : String, vehicleId : String)}
	\\Makes a pedestrian wait for a vehicle to arrive and give her a lift
	\item \texttt{cross(entityId : String)}
	\\Moves a pedestrian or a cyclist to the opposite side of the Road
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If there is an entity in the stretch near a sidewalk, it books a Road crossing
		\item No vehicles can enter stretches covered by booked zebra crossing
		\item If a stretch near a sidewalk is free (whether it is booked or not), pedestrian can start crossing the Road
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{get\_into\_house(entityId : String, houseId : String, velocity : double)}
	\\Brings an entity into a house accessible from the Road the entity is in
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the entity is in a stretch where the house \texttt{houseId} is accessible, the entity is moved into the house;
		\item Otherwise, the entity proceeds straightforward at the given velocity.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{enter\_from\_house(entityId : String, type : EntityType, stretchIndex : int)}
	\\Brings an entity out from a house and it puts the entity into the Road stretch having the given index
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An entity coming out from a house has lower priority than one entity that is already on the road. Thus before exiting the house the former has to wait for the latter to pass
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Remarks}
\ \\A lane change may happen in two cases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Overtaking: in this case, it is requested in any stretch of the road
	\item Road change: lane change must be requested at the first stretch of the road
\end{itemize}
We assume a Road is at least $n$ stretches long if it consists of $n$ lanes for motor vehicles.
