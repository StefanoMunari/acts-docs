\paragraph{Types of entities}
Three types of entities have been identified
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Active}: an entity capable to start an action by itself, 
  providing it the computational resources it needs;
  \item \textit{Reactive}: an entity with an inner state, that only acts on reaction to external inputs, 
  and it is not capable to start an action by itself;
  \item \textit{Passive}: an entity with an internal state (if necessary) which is immutable. 
   As a Reactive entity It only acts on reaction to external inputs, and it is not capable to start an action by itself.
\end{itemize}

Type     & Entities                                 \\ \hline
Active   & pedestrian, bicycle, motorcycle, car, bus, semaphore \\ \hline
Reactive & road, crossroads, sidewalk, bike lane, crossing, house \\ \hline
Passive  & road signs                               \\ \hline

The entities have the following dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Active} provides inputs to \textit{Reactive} (solid line);
  \item \textit{Active} and \textit{Reactive} can use \textit{Passive}, the dependency is not strict (dashed line).
\end{itemize}
