\paragraph{Types of entities}
Three types of entities have been identified
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Active}: entity capable to start an action by itself if provided 
the necessary computational resources;
  \item \textit{Reactive}: entity that only reacts to provided inputs, 
not capable to start an action by itself;
  \item \textit{Passive}: a stateless entity.
\end{itemize}
