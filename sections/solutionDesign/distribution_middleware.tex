\subsection{Distribution -- Middleware layer}
This section presents the services that make up the middleware.

Before seeing every service in detail, it is useful to have an overview to the
organization of those components.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{naming}: service that provides a correspondence between logic
    names and their actual location;
  \item \texttt{forwarding}: service that represents the abstraction through
    which it is possible to deliver messages to other middleware nodes;
  \item \texttt{incoming}: service that is responsible of handling messages
    coming from other middleware nodes;
  \item \texttt{interlayer}: service that represents the interface between
    the application and middleware layers;
  \item \texttt{boot}: service that is responsible to start the system neatly;
  \item \texttt{termination}: service that shut downs the node and the system
    gracefully;
  \item \texttt{snapshot}: service that takes consistent views of the node and
    the system;
  \item \texttt{coordination}: service that coordinates the interaction among
    the nodes of the system;
  \item \texttt{persistence}: service that provides a set of utilities to
    store data in a persistent way.
\end{itemize}
