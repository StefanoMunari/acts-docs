\subsubsubsection{Application - Middleware}
The communication protocol between application layer and middleware layer 
\paragraph{Fire and forget} 
It is a one-way message pattern (the service sends a message without expecting a response). 
Since the application and the middleware will reside on the same physical node we can assume 
that the communication is reliable, once a message is sent from the application layer it arrives to 
the middleware layer and viceversa.
The asynchronous communication decouples the computation of the application from the 
computation of the middleware and viceversa. The standard interfaces for communication 
implemented by application layer and middleware layer enables the use of etherogenous 
technologies for each one. Defining a standard interface is fundamental to abstract from 
the underlying technologies (implementation).
