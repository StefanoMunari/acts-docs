\subsubsubsection{Application - Middleware}
The communication protocol between application layer and middleware layer 
\paragraph{Fire and forget}
It is a one-way message pattern (the service sends a message without expecting a response). Since the application and the middleware will reside on the same physical node we can assume that the communication is reliable, once a message is sent from the application layer it arrives to the middleware layer and viceversa.
Properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Asynchronous communication}: decouples the communication from application to middleware and viceversa
\end{itemize}
