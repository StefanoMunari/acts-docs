\subsubsubsection{Termination}
When describing the shutdown of the whole system, we assumed that the
application terminates gracefully.

In this section we show the algorithm that is used to achieve this goal.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The master node $M$ stops active entities, e.g. pedestrians;
  \item $M$ saves the state of the active entities once it has stopped all of
    them;
  \item $M$ saves the state of reactive entities;
  \item $M$ terminates itself and the entire application therefore stops.
\end{enumerate}
