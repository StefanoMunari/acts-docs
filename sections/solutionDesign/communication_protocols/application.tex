\subsection{Application}
The Application is composed of two different sub-components (Figure
\ref{fig:sd-app-init}):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Application Logic Layer}: handles the application logic
    (slightly abusing the notation, we will often refer to it simply as
    \textit{Application Layer});
  \item \textbf{Interface Layer}: provides the remote services to Application
    Layer by acting as an interface towards the underlying backend layer (i.e.,
    middleware).
\end{itemize}

Thus, the Application Layer is able to communicate with other applications
transparently without knowing if they are local or remote. This modular
approach has been inspired by the TCP/IP and OSI models, in which you can
easily substitute technologies of the same level.

In the following we list the sub-layers which compose Interface Layer in
bottom up order:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Session Layer} --
  handles remote connections by means of a TCP socket;
  \item \textit{Presentation Layer} --
  handles messages formats and conversions;
  \item \textit{Service Layer} --
  It
  implements an event loop with a worker pool and different kind of queues
  for the requests (i.e. synchronous and asynchronous). It converts the
  requests into procedure calls by leveraging a skeleton object.
  Also, it offers the specular service through a stub object and a pipeline
  of handlers, necessary to build specific remote requests.
  \item \textit{Remote Layer + Tables} --
  it comprises stub and skeleton which respectively act as client and
  server parts of the local application. Also, it contains the tables used
  to dispatch the remote calls and the pending requests (i.e., synchronous
  requests which may trigger a retransmission on timeout or a local retry on
  failure).
\end{itemize}
