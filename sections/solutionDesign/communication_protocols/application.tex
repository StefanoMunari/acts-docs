\subsection{Application}
The Application is composed of two different sub-components (Figure
\ref{fig:sd-app-init}):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Application Logic Layer}: handles the application logic
    (slightly abusing the notation, we will often refer to it simply as
    \textit{Application Layer});
  \item \textbf{Interface Layer}: provides the remote services to Application
    Layer by acting as an interface towards the underlying backend layer (i.e.,
    middleware).
\end{itemize}

Thus, the Application Layer communicates with
other applications transparently without knowing if they are local or remote.
This approach has been inspired by the TCP/IP and OSI models.

The following sub-layers compose Interface Layer:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Session Layer} -
	handles remote connections though a TCP socket;
	\item \textit{Presentation Layer} -
	handles messages formats and conversions;
	\item \textit{Service Layer} -
	implements an event loop with a worker pool and different kind of queues
	for the requests (i.e. synchronous and asynchronous). It converts the
	requests into procedure calls by leveraging a skeleton object.
	Also, it offers the specular service through a stub object and a pipeline,
	necessary to build specific remote requests.
\end{itemize}
