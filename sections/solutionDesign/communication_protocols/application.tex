\subsection{Application}
The Application is composed of two different sub-components (Figure
\ref{fig:sd-app-init}):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Application Logic Layer}: handles the application logic
    (slightly abusing the notation, we will often refer to it simply as
    \textit{Application Layer});
  \item \textbf{Interface Layer (IL)}: provides the remote services to Application
    Layer by acting as an interface towards the underlying middleware layer.
\end{itemize}

In the next sections we will use the following terms to describe the state of a
software layer or a package:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|inactive| - not even created;
	\item \verb|ready| - initialized with all the needed resources. Not yet
	allowed to execute;
	\item \verb|active| - executing;
	\item \verb|stopped| - not executing. It is waiting to terminate.
\end{itemize}
