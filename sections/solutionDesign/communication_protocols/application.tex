\subsection{Application}
The Application is composed of two different sub-components (Figure
\ref{fig:sd-app-init}):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Application Logic Layer}: handles the application logic
    (slightly abusing the notation, we will often refer to it simply as
    \textit{Application Layer});
  \item \textbf{Interface Layer (IL)}: provides the remote services to Application
    Layer by acting as an interface towards the underlying middleware layer.
\end{itemize}
