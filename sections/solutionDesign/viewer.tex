\subsection{Viewer}
The viewer adopts different paradigms to communicate with the Application
Server.

The viewer exploits several networking paradigms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Push model:} used to efficiently receive realtime data from
    the Application Server; in particular, we decided to employ WebSockets
    for this purpose;
  \item \textbf{Pull model:} used for requesting static data to the
    Application Server by means of REST calls.
\end{itemize}
